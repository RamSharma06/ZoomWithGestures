# Hand Tracking Zoom Gesture 🤖

## Description
This project utilizes OpenCV and cvzone's HandTrackingModule to implement a zoom gesture using both hands. By detecting specific finger positions, the system calculates the distance between hands and adjusts the zoom level of an image accordingly.

## Features
- ✋ **Hand tracking using OpenCV and cvzone**
- 🔍 **Zoom in/out based on hand distance**
- 🎥 **Real-time camera-based interaction**

## Technologies Used
- 🛠 **Python** (Core programming language)
- 🎭 **OpenCV** (Computer vision processing)
- ✋ **cvzone** (Hand tracking module)
- 📸 **Webcam (cv2.VideoCapture)** (Live camera input)
